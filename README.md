📌Project Overview
Customer churn is a major concern for businesses, as losing customers leads to revenue loss. This project aims to predict which customers are likely to churn using machine learning techniques, helping companies take proactive retention measures.


🎯 Objective
To build a predictive model that identifies potential churners based on customer behavior and transaction history.


🛠 Technologies Used
Programming Language: Python
Libraries: pandas, NumPy, scikit-learn, matplotlib, seaborn
Model: Random Forest Classifier
Data Handling: SQL/Pandas
Visualization: Seaborn, Matplotlib


🔍 Dataset Description
The dataset contains customer-related information such as:
✅ Customer ID
✅ Gender
✅ Monthly Charges
✅ Tenure
✅ Contact Type
✅ Internet Service
✅ Total Charges
✅ Tech Support 
✅ Churn


🏗 Project Workflow
1️⃣ Data Collection: Gathered customer data from CRM or open-source datasets.
2️⃣ Data Preprocessing: Handled missing values, encoded categorical variables, and normalized data.
3️⃣ Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Identified key churn indicators using visualization.
4️⃣ Feature Engineering: Selected important features for model training.
5️⃣ Model Training: Used Random Forest Classifier for churn prediction.
6️⃣ Evaluation: Measured performance using Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-Score, and ROC-AUC.
7️⃣ Insights & Recommendations: Suggested retention strategies based on model insights.

📊 Model Performance
Accuracy: 87%
Precision: 82%
Recall: 87%
F1-Score: 84%

💡 Key Insights
High Monthly Charge and Tenure were strong indicators of churn.
Improving customer support could help reduce churn.
🚀 Future Enhancements
🔹 Test different machine learning models like XGBoost or Neural Networks.
🔹 Use Hyperparameter tuning for better performance.
🔹 Integrate real-time churn alerts for businesses.
